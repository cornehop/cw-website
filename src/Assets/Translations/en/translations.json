    "homepage.whoiscarlos": "My name is Carlos and since september 2019 I'm working as a missionary worker for <1>Operation Mobilisation in Moldova</1>. In <3>Moldova</3>, I'm part of a team that provides training for prospective missionaries. In 2020 I took part in one of these training courses, the <5>Mission Discipleship Training</5>, which unfortunately was canceled after a few weeks due to COVID-19. After many adjustments, we can continue a version of the training for international participants in 2021. This training is for 2 months in Romania and will then continue in Moldova. So a part of my work will take place in Romania.",
    "homepage.whymoldova": "I have been to Moldova three times before: in 2015 and 2017 with a youth group from the Dutch Reformed Church in Zeewolde; and in 2018 with a good friend where I traveled the last part of the journey independently. God prompted me up to three times during this trip to go to Moldova. Twice through a conversation with people I met on previous journeys, they asked me if I wanted to come for a longer term. And the third time while praying, through a song in the background. The number three is a number that is often used in the Bible and I'm sure God used this because numbers really appeal to me. After a process of several years, I now feel called to live there for a longer period of time.",
